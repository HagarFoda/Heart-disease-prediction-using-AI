# Heart-disease-prediction-using-AI
The model is trained on a dataset of patients who have been diagnosed with or without heart disease,
and the input features include factors such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and other medical measurements.

The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a new patient is likely to have heart disease
based on their input features. This can be useful for early detection and prevention of heart disease, as well as for guiding medical treatment decisions.

Once the model has been trained and validated on a dataset, it can be used on new, unseen data to make predictions.
Predicting patientsâ€™ chances of getting heart disease by applying (Bayes classifier, KNN classifier, Neural Network, decision tree classifier, linear regression, and logistic regression) on the database o Implemented using Python and MS SQL.
